# MakanSaviors

Even though Singapore prides itself on all things culinary, food waste remains one of the biggest waste streams in Singapore. Food waste accounts for roughly 10 percent of the total waste generated in Singapore, and food waste makes up about half the average waste disposed of by each household in Singapore daily.

MakanSaviors is a platform to help redistribute excess food from donors to saviors. We wish to connect individuals with each other so that surplus food can be shared, not thrown away. This could be food nearing its expiry date, or the spare groceries in your fridge that you have no intention of using. We believe that small actions can lead to big change. Collectively, we can reduce food waste as a nation and build a more sustainable future.

At Makansavior, individuals have the opportunity to offer their excess food at home to others who can make better use of it and be able to browse similar food listings posted by other users. This application empowers individuals to reduce food wastage by firstly, sharing their surplus food and secondly helping other users make use of food that would otherwise be intended to throw away. Whether you are a donor or a savior, we can all do our part to achieve zero waste in Singapore.
